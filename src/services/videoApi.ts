// Locked master prompt for all video generations
export const VIDEO_STUDIO_PROMPT = `Use the provided input image as the visual reference for the outfit, styling, and studio mood.

Create a premium high-end fashion film in a clean seamless infinity studio. Keep the outfit design, garment structure, silhouette, styling logic, fabric appearance, surface character, drape behavior, and overall visual integrity consistent with the reference image. Do not redesign the outfit. Do not add or remove design elements. Do not alter the garment's cut, length, proportions, color family, texture impression, or styling details.

Keep the studio environment minimal and elegant, matching the same clean infinity backdrop feeling. No props, no additional objects, no environmental transformation, no extra wardrobe items.

The model should remain visually consistent with the reference image in overall presentation, styling continuity, and fashion pose logic, while preserving a natural editorial fashion-film look. Maintain a refined, realistic, professional luxury campaign aesthetic.

The framing must work in both vertical and horizontal output formats. Adapt composition intelligently to the chosen format while preserving full garment readability, elegant proportions, and premium fashion presentation.

Style: luxury fashion campaign film, premium editorial, hyper-real, cinematic, clean, modern, controlled, sophisticated.
Lighting: soft professional studio lighting, flattering and balanced, subtle highlights on the garment, realistic skin tones, refined contrast, high-end fashion photography quality.
